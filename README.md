# Swallow


**This is simply a preview. There will be a tutorial when it is finished. **

Swallow is a customizable database. When it is finished, you will be able to create a project (for example, `blog`). You can then configure how the data in the project should be stored. For your blog, let's say you want a category User, which holds all the users. Each user needs to have 3 arguments: `username (str)`, `password (str)`, and `posts (list)`. You then get an ID for your project. Go to your python code and store it in an .env file. Import the package swallow, configure your project using the id, and you can add, edit, and delete data.
